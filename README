CSHATAG(1)                       User Commands                      CSHATAG(1)

NAME
       cshatag - shatag in C

SYNOPSIS
       cshatag [-h] [-n] [-q] [-v] [-V] FILE [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       cshatag is a minimal re-implementation in C of shatag
       (  https://bitbucket.org/maugier/shatag  written  in  python  by Maxime
       Augier )

       cshatag is a tool to detect silent data corruption. It writes the mtime
       and  the sha256 checksum of a file into the file's extended attributes.
       The filesystem needs to be mounted with user_xattr enabled for this  to
       work.  When  run  again,  it  compares stored mtime and checksum. If it
       finds that the mtime is unchanged but  the  checksum  has  changed,  it
       warns  on  stderr.   In  any case, the status of the file is printed to
       stdout and the stored checksum is updated.

       File statuses that appear on stdout are:
            new         sha tag has not been set
            backdated   file has been updated, mtime is older
            outdated    file has been updated, mtime is newer
            corrupt     mtime has not changed, checksum is wrong
            ok          checksum is correct

       cshatag aims to be format-compatible with  shatag  and  uses  the  same
       extended attributes (see the COMPATIBILITY section).

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Output a usage message and exit.

       -n, --dry-run
              Do  not  create  or  update any checksum attributes. Useful with
              --check.

       -q, --quiet
              Only print errors including checksum failures. Can be  specified
              multiple  times  to print even fewer messages. This is the oppo‐
              site of --verbose.

       -v, --verbose
              Print  more verbose messages error and warnings messages. Can be
              specified multiple times to print even more  messages.  This  is
              the opposite of --quiet.

       -V, --version
              Output version information about cshatag and exit.

EXAMPLES
       Typically, cshatag will be called from find:
       # find / -xdev -type f -exec cshatag {} \; > cshatag.log
       Errors  like  corrupt  files will then be printed to stderr or grep for
       "corrupt" in cshatag.log.

       To remove the extended attributes from all files:
       # find / -xdev -type f -exec setfattr -x  user.shatag.ts  {}  \;  -exec
       setfattr -x user.shatag.sha256 {} ;

RETURN VALUE
       0 Success
       1 Wrong number of arguments
       2 File could not be opened
       3 File is not a regular file
       4 Extended attributs could not be written to file
       5 File is corrupt

COMPATIBILITY
       cshatag  writes  the  user.shatag.ts field with full integer nanosecond
       precision, while python uses a double for the whole mtime and loses the
       last few digits.
